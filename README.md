A simple Pokemon GO clone.

Utilizes react native maps, camera, touch and gesture handling, sensors, and animations to achieve a very basic demo of augmented reality.

Currently only iOS is supported

Note: I have ported this app to utilize the Exponent SDK so that I can more easily get it working on both iOS and Android.  
While this project is still a useful example of how to create a Pokemon Go clone in vanilla React Native, all future work will
be continued in a new project repository: https://github.com/Traviskn/react-native-exponent-pokemon-go
